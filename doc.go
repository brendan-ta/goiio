// go-iio is a pure golang client for IIO (industrial I/O)
//
// Introduction
//
// go-iio was written to access remote iiod instanced, since libiio does
// not seem to have golang bindings by itself.
// It's main use case is connecting with remote IIOd instances: local IIO
// access is out of scope, you'll need to run iiod.
//
